This is a bus departures PWA where you can find the nearest stops and the departures of buses from them. This PWA has also a functionality to search for bus stops and to favoritize bus stops for a better experience.

The backend to this project can be found [here](https://github.com/MasterPieceSVK/AutobusyV3_backend).
